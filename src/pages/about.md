Hey, Iâ€™m Harsh, a software developer specializing in building scalable, real-world applications using modern web technologies. My approach is simple: **clean, maintainable code** and **fast iteration** to deliver products that make an impact. I enjoy taking projects from idea to execution, and Iâ€™m not afraid to dive deep into new tech if it means building something better.

### ðŸ§  What I Do

I develop AI-powered tools, web apps, and real-time systems. With deep experience in **TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and OpenAI APIs**, I work on projects that range from building developer tools to integrating AI solutions that enhance developer productivity.

### ðŸŽ­ Outside the Code

When Iâ€™m not building software, Iâ€™m probably lost in a **philosophy debate**, exploring creative artforms, or deep-diving into **anime**. I believe in continuous learning â€” whether itâ€™s technical or exploring new perspectives.
